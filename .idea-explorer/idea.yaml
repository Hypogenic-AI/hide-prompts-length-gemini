idea:
  title: Is it easier or harder to hide adversarial prompts in longer documents?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'The effectiveness of hiding adversarial prompts within documents is
    influenced by document length; longer documents may either dilute the adversarial
    effect due to increased noise or provide more space to conceal such prompts, impacting
    the success rate of adversarial instructions.

    '
  background:
    description: We all know about the adversarial prompts that look like gibberish
      but get an LLM to do something like tell you how to build a bomb or simply write
      a python function. Is it easier or harder to hide such 'instructions' in very
      long documents? Does the document create noise that overrides the adversarial
      effect or does it give more room to work with?
